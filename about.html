      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="lead">We're a group of programmers interested in learning everything we can.</p>
      <p>The Guelph Coding Community was created in response to a growing interest in the annual CS Games as an avenue for training students in programming topics that aren't covered in a traditional university environment.</p>
      <p>Since it's inception in the spring of 2013 the ambition has grown. We want to recruit as many great programmers as possible and establish Guelph as a great city for coders.</p>
      <p>The executive team helps to manage the day to day operations and keep the lights on in the event space. We're all very passionate about what we do and would love to talk to you about your interests. After all, it's the members who build the community.</p>
      <p>So invite your geeks, suggest ideas, get involved.</p>
