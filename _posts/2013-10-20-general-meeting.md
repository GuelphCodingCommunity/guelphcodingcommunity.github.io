Let's have a casual meeting to talk about what projects people are
working on. Nothing is too small!

This will be an opportunity to show off what you learned in a new
language, ask for feedback on a design, or ask questions.

The execs will be there to answer your questions so come by if you've
got some free time Wednesday evening.
